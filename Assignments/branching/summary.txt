Danni said revert means you are undoing the last local commit changes
So we can say that it was undo (?)
Git also support central repository to support collaborative work. In a git concept, this is called remote.
Each person clone repository, and send/receive new commit.

Remote Workflow:
Copy the repository to local machine
Make changes to any files
Save the changes
Make sure all the files is up-to-date
Copy back the project to remote
